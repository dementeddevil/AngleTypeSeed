# AngleTypeSeed
AngularJS+Typescript+RequireJS+ASP.NET MVC5 Seed Project

The aim of this project is to showcase the following features;

1. Use of ASP.NET MVC5 to host a hybrid Angular application
2. Setup of IIS Rewrite module to keep Angular happy
3. Use of System.Web.Optimization (the default ASP.NET bundler)
4. Setup of IIS Rewrite module to allow requirejs to fetch our bundles
5. Use of Typescript with AngularJS
6. Integration of Angular UI router and requireJS

All this from a tiny seed that represents a distilled view of my journey through the Typescript/Angular landscape.
Enjoy!
